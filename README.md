# Project: Landing Page

# The Odin Project

# I'll be making my first project, it's going to be cat themed. Why? Cuz why not ^^

# I lied, it's not cat themed, i lieeeeedddddddd

# Just finished my landing page, i didn't really commit as often because idk xD

# But this project was really fun. We had CSS Exercises that we had to do earlier, and exactly the same things we learned we had to build for this project.

# Can't wait to dive into Javascript ^^
